# Orchestrating workflows with plans

Plans are sets of tasks that can be combined with other logic. This allows you
to do complex task operations, such as running multiple tasks with one command,
computing values for the input for a task, or running certain tasks based on
results of another task. You write plans in the Puppet language. And like tasks,
plans are packaged in modules and can be shared on the Forge.
