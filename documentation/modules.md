# Modules

Many of the modules on the Puppet Forge include helpful plans and tasks that you
can install with Bolt and use in your workflows. Modules also allow you to share
your own custom Bolt tasks and plans on the Forge or use your Bolt content
programmatically.

If you're interested in creating Bolt orchestration that is
specific to your organization's infrastructure, and sharing that content with
your team, you can build a Bolt project that includes modules from the Forge.

## ðŸ§ª Managing modules in Bolt projects

**Experimental**: Bolt 2.30.0 introduced changes to how modules are managed in
Bolt projects. For more information, see [Managing
modules](managing_modules.md).
