# Modules

Many of the modules on the Puppet Forge include helpful plans and tasks that you
can install with Bolt and use in your workflows. Modules also allow you to share
your own custom Bolt content, such as tasks and plans, on the Forge or use your
Bolt content programmatically.

If you're looking for a way to use or create Bolt content that is specific to
your organization's infrastructure, and share that content with your team, a
Bolt project may be all you need. For more information, see [Bolt
projects](projects.md).
