# Run Bolt

You can use Bolt commands to connect to remote targets and perform actions on
them. These actions range in complexity from invoking a simple command to
running a series of commands and tasks as part of an orchestration workflow. 

For a full list of available Bolt commands, see the [Bolt command
reference](bolt_command_reference.md).
