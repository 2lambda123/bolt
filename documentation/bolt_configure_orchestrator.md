# Connecting Bolt to Puppet Enterprise

If you're a Puppet Enterprise (PE) customer, you can connect Bolt to Puppet Enterprise (PE) using the
Puppet Communications Protocol (PCP) transport. However, in most cases this is not
necessary, because tasks and plans are already supported from the console or the
command line using
[PEÂ orchestrator](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/running_jobs_with_puppet_orchestrator_overview.html). Wherever possible, we recommend using PE tasks and plans instead of connecting
Bolt to PE over PCP. 

For more information on tasks and plans in PE, see [Tasks and
plans](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/running_tasks_and_plans_pe.html).
