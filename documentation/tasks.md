# Making on-demand changes with tasks

Tasks are single actions that you run on target machines in your infrastructure. You use tasks to make as-needed changes to remote systems.

You can write tasks in any programming language that can run on the targets, such as Bash, Python, or Ruby. Tasks are packaged within modules, so you can reuse, download, and share tasks on the Forge. Task metadata describes the task, validates input, and controls how the task runner executes the task.
