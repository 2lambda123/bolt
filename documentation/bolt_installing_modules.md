# Installing modules

To share the Bolt plans and tasks that you've created on the Forge, you can
package them into Puppet modules. If you'd like to use a plan or task from a
module that you found on the Forge, you can use Bolt to install the module.

## Install a module

> **Before you begin**
>
> - In your Bolt project directory, create a file named `Puppetfile`. 
> - Add any modules stored locally in `modules/` to the list. For example, 
>   ```puppet
>     mod 'my_awesome_module', local: true
>   ```
>
>   **Bolt deletes any content in `modules/` that is not listed in your
>   Puppetfile.** If you want to keep the content, but you don't want to manage
>   it with the Puppetfile, move the content to a `site-modules` directory in
>   your project.

To install a module:
   1.  Open Puppetfile in a text editor and add the modules and versions that
       you want to install. If the modules have dependencies, list those as
       well. For example:
       ```puppet
       # Modules from the Puppet Forge.
       mod 'puppetlabs-apache', '4.1.0'
       mod 'puppetlabs-postgresql', '5.12.0'
       mod 'puppetlabs-puppet_conf', '0.3.0'

       # Modules from a Git repository.
       mod 'puppetlabs-haproxy', git: 'https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-haproxy.git', ref: 'master'
       ```   
   2. Run the `bolt puppetfile install` command. Bolt installs modules to the
      first directory in the `modulepath` setting. By default, this is the
      `modules/` subdirectory inside the Bolt project directory. To override
      this location, update the `modulepath` setting in your [project configuration file](bolt_project_reference.md).

## Create a new Bolt project and install a list of modules with dependencies

If you want to get started with a new Bolt project and you need specific modules
from the Puppet Forge, you can install the modules and their dependencies with
the `bolt project init` command. 

When you use `bolt project init` along with the `--modules` flag and a
comma-separated list of Forge modules, Bolt installs the latest versions of each
module and resolves and installs all dependencies required by those modules. For
example, to create a project named `example_project` with the `apache` and
`mysql` modules installed, use the following command:

```shell
bolt project init example_project --modules puppetlabs-apache,puppetlabs-mysql
```

The project's Puppetfile lists the `apache` and `mysql` modules and all of their
dependencies:

```puppet
# example_project/Puppetfile
mod 'puppetlabs-apache', '5.5.0'
mod 'puppetlabs-mysql', '10.6.0'
mod 'puppetlabs-stdlib', '6.3.0'
mod 'puppetlabs-concat', '6.2.0'
mod 'puppetlabs-translate', '2.2.0'
mod 'puppetlabs-resource_api', '1.1.0'
mod 'puppetlabs-puppetserver_gem', '1.1.1'
```

## Packaged modules

Bolt is packaged with a collection of useful modules to support common
workflows.

This list of packaged modules is available in a
[Puppetfile](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/main/Puppetfile) in the
Bolt repository. The modules and supporting documentation are publicly available
on the [Puppet Forge](https://forge.puppet.com/). 

> ðŸ”© **Tip:** To see a list of all modules on your current module path, use
> `bolt puppetfile show-modules`.

Modules installed on your module path take precedence over packaged modules with
the same name. If you need to use a specific version of a packaged module, you
can override the packaged version by installing the module into your `modules/`
directory. If youâ€™ve altered the module path in your Bolt configuration, and you
want to override a packaged module, your altered module path must include the
directory where youâ€™ve installed the module.

**Note:** If you installed Bolt as a Ruby Gem, make sure you have installed
these core modules.
