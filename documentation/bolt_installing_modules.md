# Installing modules

To share the Bolt plans and tasks that you've created on the Forge, you can
package them into Puppet modules. If you'd like to use a plan or task from a
module that you found on the Forge, you can use Bolt to install the module.

## Install a module

> **Before you begin**
> 
> - In your Bolt project directory, create a file named `Puppetfile`. 
> - Add any task or plan modules stored locally in `modules/` to the list. For
>   example, 
>   ```puppet
>     mod 'my_awesome_module', local: true
>   ```
> 
>   **Bolt deletes any content in `modules/` that is not listed in your
>   Puppetfile.** If you
>   want to keep the content, but you don't want to manage it with the Puppetfile,
>   move the content to a `site-modules` directory in your project.

To install a module:
   1.  Open Puppetfile in a text editor and add the modules and versions that
       you want to install. If the modules have dependencies, list those as
       well. For example:
       ```puppet
       # Modules from the Puppet Forge.
       mod 'puppetlabs-apache', '4.1.0'
       mod 'puppetlabs-postgresql', '5.12.0'
       mod 'puppetlabs-puppet_conf', '0.3.0'
    
       # Modules from a Git repository.
       mod 'puppetlabs-haproxy', git: 'https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-haproxy.git', ref: 'master'
       ```   
   2. Run the `bolt puppetfile install` command. Bolt installs modules to the first directory in the modulepath setting. By default, this is the `modules/` subdirectory inside the Bolt project directory. To override this location, update the modulepath setting in the [Bolt config file](bolt_configuration_reference.md).

## Packaged modules

Bolt is packaged with a collection of useful modules to support common workflows.

This list of packaged modules is available in a
[Puppetfile](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/master/Puppetfile) in the
Bolt repository. The modules and supporting documentation are publicly available
on the [Puppet Forge](https://forge.puppet.com/).

**Note:** If you installed Bolt as a Ruby Gem, make sure you have installed
these core modules.
