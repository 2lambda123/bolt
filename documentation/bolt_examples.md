# Bolt Examples

Bolt lets you automate almost any task you can think of. These examples walk you through beginning
and intermediate level Bolt use cases, demonstrating Bolt concepts along the way. You can find
shorter examples of common Bolt patterns in the [Bolt examples
repo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt-examples), which is more of a reference than a learning
tool.

If you'd like to share a real-world use case, reach out to us in the #bolt
channel on [Slack](https://slack.puppet.com).

For even more usage examples, check out the [Puppet
blog](https://puppet.com/search/?query=bolt&page=1&configure%5BhitsPerPage%5D=20&refinementList%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Post).
