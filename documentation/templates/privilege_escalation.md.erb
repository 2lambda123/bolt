# Escalating privilege with Bolt

By default, Bolt connects to, and executes on, remote systems as the same user.
Sometimes, connection and execution need to be done as separate users. For
example, you might need to install a package as the root user on a system that
doesn't allow incoming connections as the root user.  Bolt has several
configuration options for setting which user to execute as, how to escalate to
that user, and how to run commands as that user.

## Limitations

Bolt will only use the `run-as` user if:

* The target shell is Bash
* The transport is Local or SSH
* The configured `run-as` user is different than the connecting `user`

## Configuring `run-as`

You can use privilege escalation from the command-line, or set it up using Bolt's configuration files.

### Command-line options

<% @run_as_options.each do |option| -%>

#### `<%= option[:long] -%><%= option[:arg] %>`

<%= option[:desc] %>
<% end %>

### Configuration file options

You can configure escalation privilege in your `inventory.yaml` or
`bolt-defaults.yaml` files. For more information on which file to use, see
[Configuring Bolt](configuring_bolt.md).

<% @run_as.each do |option, data| -%>
#### `<%= option %>`

<%= data[:desc] %>

<% if data.key?(:type) -%>
- **Type:** <%= data[:type] %>
<% end -%>
<% if data.key?(:def) -%>
- **Default:** <%= data[:def] %>
<% end -%>

<% if data.key?(:exmp) -%>
```yaml
<%= { option => data[:exmp] }.to_yaml(indentation: 2).split("\n").drop(1).join("\n") %>
```
<% end %>
<% end %>

## How `run-as` works

Each time Bolt executes, it builds a command string to run on the remote
system. The command is built from many configuration options, including
interpreters, task input method, and the `run-as` configuration. When `run-as`
is set, the following is prepended to the command:

```
<sudo-executable> -S -H -u <run-as> -p '[sudo] Bolt needs to run as another user, password:'
```

The default `sudo-executable` is `sudo`. If you're running a task that
reads parameters from environment variables, `-E` will be appended.

> **Note:** The command is shell escaped, so each value is interpreted
> literally. This means you can't set sudo flags in the `run-as` configuration.
> Use the `run-as-command` option to specify your own sudo command and flags.

You can replace this command wholesale by specifying `run-as-command`, which
will prepend the following to the command being run:

```
<run-as-command> <run-as>
```

This enables using any executable and flags to change users. Keep in mind that:
- The `run-as-command` is non-interactive. If you set `run-as-command` and the
  system prompts for a password, Bolt will error instead of supplying the password.
- Bolt always appends the specified `run-as` user to the specified `run-as-command`,
  which can be limiting for some escalating commands.
- Bolt will not use the `run-as-command` option if `run-as` is not set.
