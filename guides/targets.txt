    targets

DESCRIPTION
    A target is a device that Bolt connects to and runs actions on. Targets can
    be physical, such as servers, or virtual, such as containers or virtual
    machines.

    Several of Bolt's commands connect to targets and run actions on them. When
    you run these commands, Bolt requires a list of targets to run the action
    on. For example, the `bolt script run` command and `Invoke-BoltScript`
    PowerShell cmdlet require you to provide a list of targets to run your
    script on. You can provide a list of targets to a command using one of the
    following command-line options:

    Shell commands
        -t, --targets TARGETS
        -q, --query   QUERY
            --rerun   FILTER

    PowerShell cmdlets
        -T, -Targets TARGETS
        -Q, -Query   QUERY
            -Rerun   FILTER

    Typically, targets and their configuration and data are listed in a
    project's inventory file. For more information about inventory files,
    see 'bolt guide inventory'.
