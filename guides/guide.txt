    guide

DESCRIPTION
    A guide is a person (or CLI tool ;D) who leads travelers through unknown or
    unfamiliar locations. The term can also be applied to a person who leads others
    to more abstract goals such as knowledge or wisdom. 

    Etymology: Originated sometime between 1325 and 1375. From Middle English
    guide, from the Old French guide, from Old Occitan guida, from guidar, from
    Frankish *wītan (“to show the way, lead”), from Proto-Germanic *wītaną (“to
    see, know; go, depart”), from Proto-Indo-European *weyd- (“to see, know”).
    Related also to English wit.
