TOPIC
    inventory

DESCRIPTION
    The inventory describes the targets that you run Bolt commands on, along
    with any data and configuration for the targets. Targets in an inventory can
    belong to one or more groups, allowing you to share data and configuration
    across multiple targets and to specify multiple targets for your Bolt
    commands without the need to list each target individually.

    In most cases, Bolt loads the inventory from an inventory file in your Bolt
    project. The inventory file is a YAML file named 'inventory.yaml'. Because
    Bolt loads the inventory file from a Bolt project, you must have an existing
    project configuration file named 'bolt-project.yaml' alongside the inventory
    file.
