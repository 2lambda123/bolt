# Releasing Bolt 

Hello, fearless reader! This document details the release process for Bolt. Our current release cadence is weekly for both the bolt gem and bolt system package, usually on Wednesdays. Here's how we do it: 

1. Ensure the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) has been updated to include all of the relevant changes included in the release under the new version header and has been merged in to the master branch.
2. Build and stage bolt packages with the [init_bolt-release job](https://jenkins-master-prod-1.delivery.puppetlabs.net/view/bolt/job/platform_bolt-vanagon_bolt-release-init_bolt-release/) using all defaults except the new tag for Bolt. The version specified will be the new tag in the github repo.
3. Once step 2 is done and you are ready to push the packages to public repositories, run the [release job](https://jenkins-master-prod-1.delivery.puppetlabs.net/view/bolt/job/platform_ship-bolt_stage-foss-artifacts-all-repos/) with all default parameters except the new tag. This will also kick off the [docs publishing job](https://jenkins-master-prod-1.delivery.puppetlabs.net/view/bolt/job/platform_ship-bolt_publish_docs/) which will build and publish the docs based on the new tag. Note that this job can be run against any REF as a stand-alone pipeline in the case where a change is needed outside of a tagged version. 
4. After packages are made public update the [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/puppetlabs/homebrew-puppet) with the new version of bolt. This can be accomplished by running the rake task `rake 'brew:cask[puppet-bolt]'` and opening a PR with the changes. Make sure the PR passes the Travis integration tests and merge the PR. 
5. Once packages are public alert the docs team in `#docs-edu-bolt` that a release announcement is ready to be published.
